.. epigraph:: Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. 
              It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical 
              illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. 
              It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution 
              and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics.

- If I have problems with eps images, in this case, also need to install ``ghostscript``;
- Do you have ImageMagick installed? LyX relies on ImageMagick to convert among graphics formats. It also needs Ghostscript installed (IM uses GS when the conversions involve PS, EPS or PDF files);
- If ``textext`` package form the AUR gives problem, simply go to **textext** official website and install it from there.
