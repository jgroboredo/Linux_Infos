PCManFM Notes
=============

.. epigraph:: PCMan File Manager (PCManFM) is a file manager application, developed by Hong Jen Yee from Taiwan, 
              which is meant to be a replacement for GNOME Files, Dolphin and Thunar. PCManFM is the standard 
              file manager in LXDE, also developed by the same author in conjunction with other developers. 
              Since 2010, PCManFM has undergone a complete rewrite from scratch; build instructions, setup and 
              configuration have changed in the process.
